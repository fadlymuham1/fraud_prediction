# Fraud Detection. Weighted Class and SMOTE for Imbalance data

In this project. I try to solve the imbalance data problem in any possible way, including Weighted class and Smote, which are then incorporated into a pipeline to prevent any data leakage. The results show that both Weighted Class and SMOTE have actually improved the model performances. However, hyperparameter tuning should be done as well to maximize the results. Sweetviz is used to do quick EDA.
