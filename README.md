# Fraud Detection. Weighted Class and SMOTE for Imbalance data

In this project. I try to solve the imbalance data problem in any possible ways, including Weighted class and Smote, which then incorporated into pipeline to prevent any data leakage. The results shows that both Weighted Class and SMOTE has actually improve the model performances. Though the hypterparamater tuning should be done as well to maximize the results.
